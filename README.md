## Setup & Installation:

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/repository-name.git
cd repository-name
2. Set up a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)
Itâ€™s recommended to create a virtual environment to avoid conflicts with other Python packages:

bash
Copy code
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
# macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate
3. Install Dependencies
Once your virtual environment is active, install the required packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
If requirements.txt does not exist, you can manually install the required libraries:

bash
Copy code
pip install selenium webdriver-manager
4. Running the Script
To scrape a TikTok profile, simply run the script:

bash
Copy code
python main.py
It will prompt you to enter a TikTok username to scrape. The script will extract the profile data and save it to a JSON file.
